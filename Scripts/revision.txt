Sudoku revisions

**Feature**
- Fixed the name of the app when it is on the device
- On finishing the board it will prompt you to save
    Whether the board is finished or not will now be displayed in the load list
    Added a data class `gameState`, I will work on using the more to clean up the code

**Fixes**
- Fixed all code warnings
- Fixed `findDuplicatesInSubGridTest`
    The way I was adding an error to the board could actually result in it being correct.
    So I made it more robust.

**To Do**
- Add dynamic back grounds and the option to have a solid background
- Add option to show if input is correct as soon as it is added
- UI pass
- Improve buttons
- Show if the board is finished or not in the load screen
- Stats
- Make `gameState` as the default way to interact with game objects
