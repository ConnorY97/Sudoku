Sudoku revisions

**Feature**
- Added a dot menu to the sudoku board, this will contain the settings and save menu
    This is the start of the UI pass. But there is still a lot to do
- Adding custom Icon
- Continue work on the UI

**Fixes**
- I was returning to the main menu is a way that was causing issues with resources.
    ```
    Approach 1: Use FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP
    This flag clears all activities above the HomeActivity in the back stack, ensuring no duplicates exist.
    ```
    This was the solution.

**Tests**
- Navigating to the main menu, this should be catching the loading resource error
- Resource loading tests
    string
    Shared preferences
    Icons

**To Do**
- Add dynamic back grounds and the option to have a solid background.
- Add option to show if input is correct as soon as it is added
- UI pass
- Improve buttons
