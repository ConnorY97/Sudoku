### Feature
- Successfully ran instrument tests locally
- Successfully ran instrument tests remotely
- Broken up the `MainActivity` class into more modular classes that have more defined responsibilities.
- Lots of code refactoring

### Fixes
- I was hard coding the difficulty for the refactor, now actually loading the correct difficulty
- Added activity ID's to the layout files so they can be identified for testing

### Tests
- I have broken up the instrument tests based on the activity being tested
- Added unit tests for the newly created classes
    These are the responsibilities extracted from the `MainActivity`

### To Do
- Add dynamic back grounds and the option to have a solid background
- Improve buttons
- Stats
